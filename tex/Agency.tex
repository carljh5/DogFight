Explain Agency.

Something about Bogost and Wardrip-Fruin, Noah et al.  - how we would expect players to react to lose of agency or false affordances.\

\commenting{mention the superstition of small actions having an influence on a seemingly unrelated outcome. e.g. blowing on dice before rolling them or the more direct of clicking the ball when catching pokémon in pokémon go}\

We hope the players will become involved and have a realistic experience by removing agency. \

Frustration\

Not a game mechanic, but an artistic statement.
