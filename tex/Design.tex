How we created the game.

why did we choose which features?

We made several consideration, to hide the procedural and deterministic nature of the prototype …
The reason for doing this was to create an illusion of a longer game, and a potentially longer relationship with the dog. We feared that if the player knew the scale of the prototype or the already determined outcomes, they would not allow themselves to become emotionally attached to the dog.
To create this illusion the UI is not build for simply supporting the features of the prototype, but also to support the affordances a longer and less procedural game could include. One of these are the option to “Breed” the dogs, which is a feature that is not actually included in the prototype, but since the player is forced to only catch dogs of one specific gender, they will never discover this.

Impotent options. Mimicing the Pokemon games we initially implemented the following fight options ‘Fight’, ‘Use Item’, ‘Switch Dog’, ‘Run’. The options did not do anything within the game.

Even though the player has limited agency in the fight system, we still simulate the fights with a very game-like system.


Choosing a vertical display for the phone for accessibility and to signal the briefness of the play session.

By only allowing one choice per game week, we implicitly associate a cost with the action, and an investment in your dog.
