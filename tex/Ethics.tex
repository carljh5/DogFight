Explain the boundaries of ethics in games. \

Postal and Columbine reactions and references\

The lines are not the same as for other art forms. Reference. In other arts the actual hurting of animals are necessary for outrage\

Why? Because games are more entertainment, not art? because of the embodiedment of players/ the subjective point of view? We chose to do something so it becomes up to us to define whether this fits our moral, while we can understand a film or book as someone elses narrative and moral. If true, this also positions games as a more potent medium for provocative art. \
