One of the main reasons for this paper and game is the interest in figuring out the ethical boundaries of games, and whether those boundaries are different for games, than for other art mediums. It is our hypothesis that the rules that apply for what is socially acceptable as subject matter in movies or books, are not nessecarily the same rules that apply for games. We believe a book about a dog fighter, would in no way cause the same amount of controversy and public outrage as a game, where you play as a dog fighter. \

We could simply argue that it is because that games are viewed mainly as entertainment, while movies and books are accepted art forms. That games right now are in the social state of films in the 1920's and will naturally evolve and become accepted as mediums of art. This does become a little too trivial an explanation, and does not deal with the fact that games are by design a more engaging and embodying experience.\

In \citep{sicart2011ethics}, Sicart reasons that when playing a single-player computer game the player, phenomonologically, is the subject that experiences the game not as an object, but as a process that interacts with and rewards the player. Here, we find a fundamental difference between games as a medium and as abstract art, since people would have it easier to describe a book as an objective experience, where the reader does not experience the book as interacting with them, but as an object, that expresses the author as a subject. It is simply easier to deem something as not being unethical, when you can see it completely as someones opionion or expression of art. With games it becomes much harder to accept them, since they are viewed as a process, and hence the actions the game allow you to take is not only the expression of an authors morality, but also the players, which could potentially be you or someone you know. \

Many people also consider games to be a medium, exclusively or mainly for kids. This of course explains 

The game series Grand Theft Auto\cite{north2013grand} is one of, if not the, most popular examples of game moral controversies. 
similar to sopranos, not generally discussed as being unethical, even if consisting of immoral actions of the main characters.
\


in Super Columbine Massacre RPG\cite{ledone2005super}, the player is rewarded for completing actions, they do not feel comfortable with. 

"This tension is crucial for understanding the potential of computer games as ethical experiences."
\

It is also important to note that rules have moral values, so if we reward molesting a child it will give the game a certain (lack of) morality, same as if we reward the killing of gangsters. So if we arbitrarily reward the player for moral or immoral actions in the game, it will create a moralizing effect.\

One main problem with ethics exploration in games, is that when games allow for a wide range of possibilities,

life-simulator that is a 1-to-1 adaption of real-life, only with the one change being that you are aware that this is a game, and 
life-simulator, could bring out extremely destructive or libertine behavior in people, when playing those games




Can dog fighting be used as subject matter, witout the game just being provocative escapism, but by putting the player in the place of unknown peoples

Explain the boundaries of ethics in games. \

Postal and Columbine reactions and references\

The lines are not the same as for other art forms. Reference. In other arts the actual hurting of animals are necessary for outrage\

Why? Because games are more entertainment, not art? because of the embodiedment of players/ the subjective point of view? We chose to do something so it becomes up to us to define whether this fits our moral, while we can understand a film or book as someone elses narrative and moral. If true, this also positions games as a more potent medium for provocative art. \ 

\subsection{The Background Story}

Rat Kid Background / justification for unethical affordances\

Character makes fate (Heraclitus, gta, Miguel), we used the same to allow these affordances \

interested in testing when the game is perceived as unethical\
