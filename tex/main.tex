	Something that is happening. Can we make a serious game that is tackling this issue.


\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{ProbStat}

Dog fighting is a brutal blood sport, which often results in serious injuries or death of the participating dogs. While it is illegal in most countries, with Japan, Honduras and Russia being the exceptions, it is still practiced illegally in many countries for entertainment and betting purposes. \

Violence and other illegal subject matter in video games, while being the cause of many controversies, are generally commonplace in many popular video games. While the causality between video game violence and aggressive behaviour can be questioned \citep{boxer, ferguson} there exist no literature to our knowledge that proofs a causality between playing games with illegal subject matter and committing those types of crimes. \

Despite having inherent game mechanics, dog fighting is not generally used as subject matter. We expect this to be because of the social norms and developers€™ fears of public outrage or ostracisation. \

In this project, we will analyse how to use dog fighting as subject matter in games. Inspired by \cite{sicart2011ethics}, we are interested in examining whether unethical affordances is able to exist in a game with a purpose, as well as how player agency, or the lack thereof, will contribute to the players frustration over the loss of their dogs. \

We will work with the following Research Questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item RQ1. Can we create unethical affordances, namely dog fighting, in a game without making it an unethical game?
\item RQ2. Will the player be able to feel empathy for the dogs, while being reliant on them fighting?
\item RQ3. How does the player feel, when they lose their dogs, while lacking the agency to prevent it?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
The project will include an overview of the field of dog fighting games, as well as a case study of the ethics of computer games. \

We will produce the mobile dog fighting game €˜Rat Kid Dog Fight!€™. We will conduct extensive playtests, focusing on the reactions of players in particular game situations.\

The main character in the game will be portrayed as one of the 15.000 homeless children of Mexico City \citep{baverstock}, which tries to break the circle of drug abuse and prostitution, by training stray dogs to battle in the illegal dogfights of the local gangs. This narrative will make dog fighting the only viable option for the character and will be presented as a lesser of two evils, which can help the players justify their own actions. \

The gameplay mechanics will draw similarities to the Pokemon game series (\citep{game:pokemon}) and other pet management games, where the player is also afforded the option of pitting animals against each other. While we are interested in having minimal player agency in the dog fights, the Pokemon similarities should create the expectancy of player agency \citep{wardrip2009agency}. \

We will experimentally determine how this loss of player agency in the battles will affect the player€™s reactions to the death of their dog. The end result being an investigation of how gameplay elements and game affordances are able to imminently immerse the player, but also how it can make them reflect on their personal morality about the subject matter.\

Finally, we will determine from the prototype and test data how we can best continue development towards a full-featured mobile game, and if such a game would be best suited for retail distribution or art exhibitions.\

\section{Conclusion}
Ethical or not?
Moral or not? General reaction as ethical and not moralizing. Emil thought humour made it unethical. Thora thought of it as a piece of art and hence morality and ethics were not important, just the message.\

Reaction to no agency. \

Dilemma of research - blind testing vs. questions before testing.
	how would we do the test over

Implementation and platform for the future game.\

While sensibilities might change as the norms of our society does, it is always the responsibility of the artist to push at and test the boundaries of those sensibilities, as well as their legitimacy. \
