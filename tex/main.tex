\section{Introduction}
\blockquote{
"If nothing else makes Mr. London's book popular, it ought to be rendered so by the complete way in which it will satisfy the love of dog fights apparently inherent in every man."

- Quote from review of \textit{"Call of the Wild"} \citep{london1997call} from \textit{New York Times}, 1903 \citep{barnesnoble}
}

The above quote tells of a time, where dog fighting was not only romantizised, but also glorified. Many earlier works of litterature share this depiction of staged fights between or against animals, as something inherently aestethic and masculine. \

Recently \textit{Guggenheim Museum} in New York decided to pull three major works from a highly anticipated exhibition after pressure from animal-rights supporters.\citep{guggenheim} One of the works was a seven-minute video of eight American Pit Bull Terriers, a breed of dogs mostly known for their aggressiveness and popularity in illegal dog fighting. In the video the dogs are opposite each other, fixated on thread mills, exhausting themselves trying to reach, and presumably maul, the others. An online petition against the art works was signed by 600.000 and after receiving several threats of death and violence Guggenheim pulled the works \“out of concern for the safety of its staff, visitors and participating artists.\”.\

The boundaries for what is socially acceptable are always changing, but it becomes both a democratic and cultural problem, when established cultural institutions have to pull works from fear of reprecussions. Art in its essence needs to be able to deal with the hard topics and dilemmas of our society.\ 

For video games the boundaries even tighter. Video games are often not even considered an art form, and have even stricter rules for what subjects they are allowed to examine. \

We live in a world, where cruelty against animal and people is happening every day. The arts need to be able to examine the reasons and culture behind even these actions. Video games are in their definition able to put the player in the place of unknown characters and thereby convey feelings and settings that would otherwise be completely alien to the player.\

We are interested in determining, whether we can create a game about street kids and dog fighting without the game becoming neither unethical nor moralizing.\

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{ProbStat}

Dog fighting is a brutal blood sport, which often results in serious injuries or death of the participating dogs. While it is illegal in most countries, with Japan, Honduras and Russia being the exceptions, it is still practiced illegally in many countries for entertainment and betting purposes. \

Violence and other illegal subject matter in video games, while being the cause of many controversies, are generally commonplace in many popular video games. While the causality between video game violence and aggressive behaviour can be questioned \cite{boxer, ferguson} there exist no literature to our knowledge that proofs a causality between playing games with illegal subject matter and committing those types of crimes. \

Despite having inherent game mechanics, dog fighting is not generally used as subject matter. We expect this to be because of the social norms and developers€™ fears of public outrage or ostracisation. \

In this project, we will analyse how to use dog fighting as subject matter in games. Inspired by \cite{sicart2011ethics}, we are interested in examining whether unethical affordances is able to exist in a game with a purpose, as well as how player agency, or the lack thereof, will contribute to the players frustration over the loss of their dogs. \

We will work with the following Research Questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item RQ1. Can we create unethical affordances, namely dog fighting, in a game without making it an unethical game?
\item RQ2. Will the player be able to feel empathy for the dogs, while being reliant on them fighting?
\item RQ3. How does the player feel, when they lose their dogs, while lacking the agency to prevent it?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}
The project will include an overview of the field of dog fighting games, as well as a case study of the ethics of computer games. \

We will produce the mobile dog fighting game €˜Rat Kid Dog Fight!€™. We will conduct extensive playtests, focusing on the reactions of players in particular game situations.\

The main character in the game will be portrayed as one of the 15.000 homeless children of Mexico City \citep{baverstock}, which tries to break the circle of drug abuse and prostitution, by training stray dogs to battle in the illegal dog fights of the local gangs. This narrative will make dog fighting the only viable option for the character and will be presented as a lesser of two evils, which can help the players justify their own actions. \

The gameplay mechanics will draw similarities to the Pokemon game series \citep{game:pokemon} and other pet management games, where the player is also afforded the option of pitting animals against each other. While we are interested in having minimal player agency in the dog fights, the Pokemon similarities should create the expectancy of player agency \citep{wardrip2009agency}. \

We will experimentally determine how this loss of player agency in the battles will affect the player€™s reactions to the death of their dog. The end result being an investigation of how gameplay elements and game affordances are able to imminently immerse the player, but also how it can make them reflect on their personal morality about the subject matter.\

Finally, we will determine from the prototype and test data how we can best continue development towards a full-featured mobile game, and if such a game would be best suited for retail distribution or art exhibitions.\

\section{Conclusion}
%Ethical or not?\
In our ethics summary we found that the degree of linearity and possibility space can determine, whether a game with unethical affordances are perceived as being unethical. We also found the a lack of consequences and realism could result in a more unethical game and especially that forcing the player to do unpleasant actions, could create a great uncomfortability and tension, which could be used as an artistic agent.\

%back story
In our prototype of \textit{Rat Kid Dog Fight!} we tried to allow for the player to participate in dog fights, but also to reflect over the concept of dog fighting and the conditions of street kids in Mexico City. We did this by creating a linear experience, where the player was put in the place of a street kid, using both the setting and the choice between two evils as narrative means of justifying the participation in dog fighting.\

%worked - as seen by testers.
We deem this experiment as successful, with regards to our testers mostly not viewing the game as unethical. Many of our testers also reflected on the lives of homeless children and the culture of dog fighting, describing the experience as unpleasant, but educational and thought-provoking.\

%also important not to moralize
It was also our ambition to not create a moralizing experience. We did not want the players to feel like they had to act or behave in a certain way for the game to reward, and allow for them to feel and act towards the dogs as they wanted, within the confines of the game. While most testers found the game to not be moralizing, there were still testers, that felt they had to pick specific actions, because they were the \textit{correct} ones. \

%Moral or not? General reaction as ethical and not moralizing. Emil thought humour made it unethical. Thora thought of it as a piece of art and hence morality and ethics were not important, just the message.\

%Reaction to no agency. \
We were careful not to arbitrarily reward unethical behavior, but simply present the options as a means of survival. We still tried to create some uncomfortability by creating an illusion of agency in fights, which were meant to be broken. This would hopefully have created an understanding of the impotence of the main character. Unfortunately only one of our testers discovered the lack of agency and that only made him lose interest in the gameplay, even though he did understand the mechanic being an allegory of the kid's situation.\ 

%Dilemma of research - blind testing vs. questions before testing.
%	how would we do the test over

We established that it could be possible to create an actual game about dog fighting, without it becoming unethical or moralizing by default. To develop a game like this we would not include the same amount of humour, especially in regards to the Pokemon references. We would not include the illusion of agency, but still allow for player superstition, by being able to shout commands during the fight, and instead focusing on the actual gameplay - the breeding, catching and training of your dogs, and then ultimately dealing with the unlucky loss of your best friend. A game like this could either aim at being released as an art work at an exibition or as a retail release, as long as the definition is clear, and the gameplay affordances and marketing reflects it.\

%Implementation and platform for the future game.\ less humour, choise removed, no illusion of agency, but room for superstition and focus on where the agency really is.
No matter the actual implementation, the most important thing is to not remove the \textit{bite} of the game \- not remove its curiosity for man's darker feelings or forgotten creatures, nor its attempt at an artistic expression. While sensibilities might change as the norms of our society does, it is always the responsibility of the artist to push at and test the boundaries of those sensibilities, as well as their legitimacy. \
